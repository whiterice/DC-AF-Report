\subsubsection{Power Monitoring and Energy Management Systems}
\label{Sub:Exp:PM}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:PM:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\	
An electrical power distribution system is the crucial backbone of any facility. In today's industrial environment there are a few pivotal demands on electrical systems. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reliability of supply
	\item Cost control and allocation
	\item Power quality monitoring and assurance
\end{itemize}

Power monitoring and energy management systems enable full overview and insight into existing and historical energy consumption. With the right implementation this information can be accessible anywhere and at any time. 

Existing power monitoring equipment may already be installed in the facility. In many cases only a small step is required to bring this available data into an Energy Management System. By having an Energy Management System it allows for a centralized approach to monitor and analyze Water, Air, Gas, Electricity, and Steam (W.A.G.E.S.) data. 

PowerCore Engineering can provide customized Energy Management solutions by: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilizing existing communication-ready power meters
	\item Adding new power monitors in selected locations
	\item Working on different hardware platforms by combining power meters by leading manufacturers
	\item Providing Central Energy Management software to integrate all remote meters and integrate it in the existing Building/Process management system
	\item Providing customized reporting tools based on SQL database and/or MS Excel TM
	\item Web-based remote control and monitoring

\end{itemize}


Decisions on location of electrical supply for large equipment or analysis of the financial impact of production schedules is made easy. The benefits of service from PowerCore Engineering are clear in Power Monitoring whether a stand alone digital meter or a fully integrated Internet-ready Energy Management system is needed. 

%\subsubsubsection{Experience}
%\label{Sub:Exp:PM:Exp}

\subsubsection{Power System Maintenance}
\label{Sub:Exp:PSM}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:PSM:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\	 
Keeping power distribution systems up to standard requires periodic electrical testing and maintenance programs to be in place (see International Electrical Testing Association's article on the issue: Frequency of Maintenance Tests) Generally, 1-3 year testing frequency is advisable depending on the age and condition of the equipment. 

Even if a periodic maintenance and testing program is in place, the resources or time to manage and oversee an effective economic testing program may not be available. Although PowerCore Engineering is not in the business of electrical maintenance and testing, the company acts as consultants on the design, implementation, and oversight of the electrical testing and maintenance. 

PowerCore has an extensive experience in field testing electrical power distribution equipment and is able to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Devise an effective electrical testing program
	\item Prepare testing specifications and schedules
	\item Eliminate unnecessary testing (frequency and scope)
	\item Assist in selecting testing agencies or contractors
	\item Ensure that the selected testing agency performs the work as outlined
	\item Review the results of the tests and recommend actions only as necessary
\end{itemize}

Having PowerCore Engineering as an acting consultant saves money in the long term by reducing maintenance cost without sacrificing effectiveness. Not only is it ensured that any problems encountered are dealt with in a timely and effective manner, but also that a fair price is paid for only the components needed.

\subsubsection{Power Measurement}
\label{Sub:Exp:PowM}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:PowM:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\
Whether or not a Power Monitoring System is installed there is always an occasional need to perform on-the-spot power measurement to evaluate particular load parameters such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Load Flow
	\item Voltage Swings
	\item Power Factor
	\item Power Quality
\end{itemize}
Local power measurements are typically required if there is a need to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assess loading of a selected feeder(s)
	\item Decide whether particular feeders can accept large load additions
	\item Measure Harmonic Distortion when the power quality of the supply is in question
	\item Provide Power Factor compensation for a facility or locally to release capacity
	\item Calculate the projected impact of large load installation
\end{itemize}

The Portable Power Monitoring Package based on PML ION 7500 meter provides all the necessary information within moments. The power monitors are typically installed in customer specified locations for a period of 1-7 days, but other arrangements are possible. When installing the power monitor power interruption is usually not required.

\subsubsection{Ground Fault Tracing Systems}
\label{Sub:Exp:SR}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:SR:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\
Since Ground Faults represent 90\% of all electrical faults an effective and quick Ground Fault detection system is vital to all facilities. 

Detection 
Ground indicator lights are the minimum requirement of the Canadian Electrical Code (Rule 10-106 (2) ). This is by no means an ideal setup since they require daily inspection. Ideally, Power Monitoring systems are used to send email, page, or SMS messages to the appropriate people to deal with the issue. 

PowerCore Engineering supplies, installs, and commissions the Neutral Voltage and Current Monitoring system on any distribution system as follows: 
Installs a current monitoring CT and voltage monitoring circuit and ties them either into an existing energy management system or supplies and installs a suitable power monitor
Configures the Power Monitor and the Energy Managemnt software to alarm on neutral to ground voltage and neutral current present. The alarm can be displayed using the energy management software or any other SCADA/HMI system present in the facility.
Configures the Energy Management Server to launch an external alarm program to email or page appropriate personnel.
Location 

Once a ground fault is detected, it is advisable to clear it as soon as possible. Locating a ground fault is a task that can dishearten any electrician and can be a time consuming and frustrating task which may require shutting down vital equipment and disruption of the power supply. 

An alternative non-disruptive method of locating a ground fault within the system is to implement a pulsating ground current concept. 
A parallel grounding resistor is inserted into the circuit via a pulsating relay that operates at a predefined frequency.
A large probe is then applied around a set of three phase conductors at different power feeders and connected to a suitable DMM.
The feeder that has a ground fault on it will display a pulsating signal at a predefined frequency, thus narrowing down the ground fault search (see diagram).

\subsubsection{Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Applications}
\label{Sub:Exp:VFD}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:VFD:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\
Motor Starter and Variable Frequency Drive applications range from a simple stand alone starter application to a full blown Starter/VFD/Bypass system. On the VFD side, most applications require careful sizing of the system components as well as proper feature selection (Vector/Frequency/Servo control VFD, external references, communication, etc.). The starter applications (across-the-line or soft-start with a bypass) typically present complications only when large motors are involved (200 HP and higher). In such cases, a system simulation to assess large motor starting current effects is advisable to avoid voltage stability problems in the facility. 

PowerCore Engineering helps with such aspects of independent Customized VFD/Starter Application as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item VFD/Starter selection based on process requirement
	\item System simulation of the large starter application (across-the-line vs. Soft-start)
	\item Line/Load reactors for VFD selection
	\item Drive/Starter supply, installation, and programming
	\item External control interface (Digital and Analogue controls)
	\item Communication interface to external SCADA or energy management systems
	\item Control and interface drawings
\end{itemize}

A VFD or a soft starter installed can be a very effective and economical way to control large motor loads. Having it properly sized and selected can avoid many problems and pitfalls that may be associated with such an application.

\subsubsection{Power/Control System Troubleshooting }
\label{Sub:Exp:SR}

%\subsubsubsection{Description}
%\label{Sub:Exp:SR:Desc}
\textbf{Description}\\
\\
Outdated drives or motor starters, a customized control system or a specialized I/O rack breakdown wreaks havoc on any production schedule. Moreover, if the original supplier or installer is not available small failures easily morph into huge problems if the solutions are not administered promptly. 

PowerCore offers help in such cases with: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item On-site/Off-site troubleshooting and repair of industrial and commercial electrical and electronic equipment
	\item Reverse engineering (re-constructing system drawings and operation manuals in the absence of the original documentation)
	\item Outdated and rare equipment sourcing
	\item Replacement of obsolete parts with up-to-date equivalents
	\item Re-design and supply installations for unrepairable components or systems
\end{itemize}
