\section{Consistency in Staffing}
\label{CS}

PowerCore Engineering will be utilizing the employees listed in the \hyperref[ETQ:IndExp]{Individual Experience} section to perform the requested services.  A lead employee will be assigned to this account when the project is awarded. The lead employee will draw on other team members to service the customer's needs.  In the event of an emergency call, the lead contact will be dispatched.  In the unlikely event where the project lead isn't available, a secondary contact will be dispatched.  The secondary contact will be elected internally based on past experience and knowledge of the system. 

\pagebreak

\section{Response Time and Availability}
\label{RTA}

PowerCore Engineering's office hours are from 8 am to 4:30 pm.  If an emergency arises outside of the office hours, over time rates will apply.  PowerCore Engineering's Office is located just off the 401, therefore the typical response time to an emergency call will be 1 hour and 20 minutes.  If emergency call is placed after hours, the response time may be extended to the 1 hour and 50 minutes for additional travel to the office to collect any tools.  Also, depending on the nature of the issue, PowerCore may be able to provide assistance remotely.

\section{Invoicing}
\label{Inv}

PowerCore Engineering utilizes Quickbase Customer Relationship Management software for accurate invoice processing and tracking.  This management software, in conjunction with PowerCore's internal practices for tracking employee time ensure that billing remains organized.  PowerCore Employees are responsible for filling out time-sheets daily and biweekly are required to submit their time for review.\\

Invoices are typically sent over email and include work order numbers and descriptions as reference for customers.  If Jobs are completed on a time and material structure, the R/T, O/T and material are all displayed as separate line items.  Invoice structure can be modified to fit customer needs, but PowerCore has been successful using the structure similar to the \hyperref[fig:Ir5000]{sample invoice} displayed in this section.\\

PowerCore also submits status reports when working on larger project that help keep the customer informed and to ensure there are no surprise costs when invoiced. Please see  \hyperref[fig:Page1OfProgressReport]{Page 1} and \hyperref[fig:Page2OfProgressReport]{Page 2} of the example Progress Summary in the following section.\\
