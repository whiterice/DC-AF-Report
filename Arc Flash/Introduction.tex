\subsection{Introduction to Project}
\label{af:intro:proj}

The Arc Flash Hazard Evaluation Study for \Customer{} was prepared by PowerCore Engineering.\\

The Arc Flash Hazard Evaluation Study determined: the Arcing Fault Clearing Time, Limits of Approach, Working Distance, Incident Energy, Clothing Requirements and Hazard Area Classifications for all electrical equipment within the scope of the study.\\

Arc Flash Study was performed in compliance with IEEE Std-1584-2002 and CSA Z462-15. The study was based on the short-circuit information and protective device settings provided by \Customer{}.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{af:intro:scope}

The study results shall be the basis for implementation of an Arc Flash Hazard Program, that will meet regulation NFPA 70E, CSA Z462 as well as IEEE-1584.\\
